Django as Micro Web Framework

## what it is

Django is Python-based powerful web framework. It is powerful, powerful, and powerful. So, it is too powerful.

We sometimes need to do a project from zero. But, we have loved Django. That's why we need a very small Django with no contrib, no orm, no form, no this, no that, etc. We can still, however, use one of them if necessary.

## how to use

`./main.py runserver`
